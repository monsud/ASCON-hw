# ASCON Implementation Project

## Overview

This project showcases both hardware and software implementations of the ASCON cryptographic algorithm. ASCON is a lightweight and secure authenticated encryption algorithm.

### ASCON 128 - Hardware Implementation

In the hardware implementation, we have designed and implemented ASCON 128 on FPGA for efficient and high-performance cryptographic operations. The hardware implementation provides accelerated encryption and decryption processes, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

#### Hardware Requirements

- FPGA Board (e.g., [Specify the FPGA board model])
- FPGA Development Environment (e.g., [Specify the development tools])

#### Hardware Implementation Details

[Provide details about the hardware implementation, including any optimizations or features specific to the FPGA platform.]

### ASCON HMAC and KMAC - Software Implementation

In addition to the hardware implementation, this project includes software implementations of ASCON HMAC and KMAC. These are cryptographic hash functions that use the ASCON algorithm for secure message authentication and key derivation.

#### Software Requirements

- Programming Language: [Specify the programming language used, e.g., C, Python]
- Dependencies: [List any external libraries or tools required]

#### Software Implementation Details

[Explain the software implementations of ASCON HMAC and KMAC, including usage instructions and any specific considerations for developers or users.]
